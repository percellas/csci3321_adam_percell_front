  <h4> Ingredients </h4>
  <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>5 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni</li>
  </ul>
  <h4> Directions </h4>
  <ol>
      <li>Dissolve 1/2 teaspoon sugar in 1 cup of warm water in a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over the water and let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Mix flour, 3/4 cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture, beaten eggs, and melted butter. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1.5 hours.</li>
      <li>Preheat an over to 350 degrees (175C). Grease a cookie sheet.</li>
      <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into 20 equal pieces about the size of a golf ball. Using your hands, flatten each piece into a small rectangle about 4 inches square. Place 3 slices of pepperoni down the center of each dough square, overlapping the slices. Place another row of 3 slices next to the first. Roll the dough around the pepperoni slices, pinch the edges closed, and place the rolls on the prepared cookie sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 14 to 16 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned and the tops are barely golden.</li>
